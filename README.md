# DataScience
This Repository includes all the computer assignments which are designed by me as the TA in "Applied Data Science" course.
The solutions are included as well. 
For ease of usage, the projects are provided in Jupyter Notebook.
These assignment are excelent practices for any student who wants to get more familiar with data science, machine learning, text manipulation, web crawling and generally every skill that a data scentist should possess.
Hope you enjoy !
